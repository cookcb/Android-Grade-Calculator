# Android-Grade-Calculator
Android application that will keep track of class grades and assignments.

Allows a user to keep track up up to 7 school classes. For each course, the user can input grades along with their associated weights and the application will present the user with a calculated overall course grade. This allows for easy management throughout the year so the user can always know how well they are doing in a course.

Currently working on minor bugs with the user interface. Will be released to the play store soon.
